Hello sir, do you know how I can get to the highway from here?
Old Timer: What the hell are you doing out this way at this hour?! It's not safe!
I got lost looking for Miller's Barbecue. I've heard their pork shoulders are unlike anywhere else.
Old Timer: They don't serveâ€” hmm. Nevermind that. 
...so, anyway, I'm just trying to get to the Interstate now.
Old Timer: Just keep on this road. You'll know you're almost there when you cross the train tracks.
Old Timer: Whatever you do, DON'T turn off the road. And don't get out of the car, neither. There are older and fouler things in these woods than the pine trees. Things that look where you can't see and follow where you can't flee.
< What's that supposed to mean? >
Great, thank you! Have a good night, stay dry.
Old Timer: Watch the road. Good luck.
