Hello sir, do you know how I can get to the highway from here?
Old Timer: What are you doing all the way out here this late? It's not safe.
I got lost looking for Miller's Barbecue. I've heard their pork shoulders are unlike anywhere else.
Old Timer: ...
...so, anyway, I'm just trying to get to the Interstate now.
Old Timer: Just keep following the road. Don't take any turns.
Great, thank you! Have a good night, stay dry.
Old Timer: Watch the road.
